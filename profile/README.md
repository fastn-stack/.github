`fastn` is a programming language and a web-framework for building user
interfaces and content-centric websites. `fastn` is easy to learn, especially
for non-programmers, but does not compromise on what you can build with it.

Install from https://fastn.com/install/ or download directly from [GitHub
Releases](https://github.com/fastn-stack/fastn/releases).

See [the README](https://github.com/fastn-stack/fastn?tab=readme-ov-file)
of fastn or visit https://fastn.com/ to learn more.

We're currently working on `fastn` 0.5. It will add support for making
offline-first p2p apps based on [iroh](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh) and
[automerge](https://github.com/automerge/automerge) along with some breaking
changes to the language.
